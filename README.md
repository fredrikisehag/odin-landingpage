# odin-landingpage

This is a project I am doing from The Odin Project
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

The goal is to become better at HTML and CSS. All starts from the
instructions in the link, then it's up to me to complete it.

Before I started this repository and files I have been sketching on
paper to come up with an idea of how i want to structure my HTML and
CSS.
